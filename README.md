Installing Third-Party Modules(pip tool):

Beyond the standard library of modules packaged with Python, other developers have written their own modules to extend Python’s capabilities even further. The primary way to install third-party modules is to use Python’s pip tool. This tool securely downloads and installs Python modules onto your computer from https://pypi.python.org/, the website of the Python Software Foundation. PyPI, or the Python Package Index, is a sort of free app store for Python modules.

Installing PIP:
Linux: sudo pip3 install <ModuleName>
Upgrade : pip3 install –U <ModuleName>

File Path in Win & Linux
On Windows, you can find pip at C:\Python34\Scripts\pip.exe
Linux, it is in /usr/bin/pip3.

After installing the module, you can test that it installed successfully by running import ModuleName in the interactive shell. If no error messages are displayed, you can assume the module was installed successfully.

Note : replace pip with pip3 if you’re on OS X or Linux.
