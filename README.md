Installing Third-Party Modules(pip tool):

Beyond the standard library of modules packaged with Python, other developers have written their own modules to extend Python’s capabilities even further. The primary way to install third-party modules is to use Python’s pip tool. This tool securely downloads and installs Python modules onto your computer from https://pypi.python.org/, the website of the Python Software Foundation. PyPI, or the Python Package Index, is a sort of free app store for Python modules.

File Path in Win & Linux
On Windows, you can find pip at C:\Python34\Scripts\pip.exe
Linux, it is in /usr/bin/pip3.
