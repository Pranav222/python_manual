Shebang Line

The first line of all your Python programs should be a shebang line, which tells your computer that you want Python to execute this program. The shebang line begins with #!, but the rest depends on your operating system.

    On Windows, the shebang line is #! python3.

    On OS X, the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/env python3.

    On Linux, the shebang line is #! /usr/bin/python3.

You will be able to run Python scripts from IDLE without the shebang line, but the line is needed to run them from the command line
